In case of failure of any person to comply with any subpoena lawfully issued, or on the refusal of any witness to produce evidence or to testify to any matter regarding which the person may be lawfully interrogated, the district court shall, upon application of the office, compel obedience proceedings for contempt, as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued by the court or a refusal to testify therein.

(b) If the office finds probable cause to believe that any cannabis plant, cannabis flower, cannabis product, artificially derived cannabinoid, lower-potency hemp edible, or hemp-derived consumer product is being distributed in violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, the office shall affix to the item a tag, withdrawal from distribution order, or other appropriate marking providing notice that the cannabis plant, cannabis flower, cannabis product, artificially derived cannabinoid, lower-potency hemp edible, or hemp-derived consumer product is, or is suspected of being, distributed in violation of this chapter, and has been detained or embargoed, and warning all persons not to remove or dispose of the item by sale or otherwise until permission for removal or disposal is given by the office or the court.

The office shall release the cannabis plant, cannabis flower, cannabis product, artificially derived cannabinoid, lower-potency hemp edible, or hemp-derived consumer product when this chapter and rules adopted under this chapter have been complied with or the item is found not to be in violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter.

(2) if the violation can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the cannabis plant, cannabis flower, cannabis product, artificially derived cannabinoid, lower-potency hemp edible, or hemp-derived consumer product, the court, after entry of the decree and after costs, fees, and expenses have been paid, and a good and sufficient bond conditioned that the cannabis plant, cannabis flower, cannabis product, artificially derived cannabinoid, lower-potency hemp edible, or hemp-derived consumer product must be properly labeled or processed has been executed, may by order direct that the cannabis plant, cannabis flower, cannabis product, artificially derived cannabinoid, lower-potency hemp edible, or hemp-derived consumer product be delivered to the claimant for proper labeling or processing under the supervision of the office. The office's supervision expenses must be paid by the claimant. The cannabis plant, cannabis flower, cannabis product, artificially derived cannabinoid, lower-potency hemp edible, or hemp-derived consumer product must be returned to the claimant and the bond must be discharged on representation to the court by the office that the cannabis plant, cannabis flower, cannabis product, artificially derived cannabinoid, lower-potency hemp edible, or hemp-derived consumer product is no longer in violation and that the office's supervision expenses have been paid.

(e) If the office finds in any room, building, piece of equipment, vehicle of transportation, or other structure any cannabis plant, cannabis flower, cannabis product, artificially derived cannabinoid, lower-potency hemp edible, or hemp-derived consumer product that is unsound or contains any filthy, decomposed, or putrid substance, or that may be poisonous or deleterious to health or otherwise unsafe, the office shall condemn or destroy the item or in any other manner render the item as unsalable, and no one has any cause of action against the office on account of the office's action.

(f) The office may enter into an agreement with the commissioner of agriculture to analyze and examine samples or other articles furnished by the office for the purpose of determining whether the sample or article violates this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter.

(d) The office shall promptly inspect cannabis businesses and hemp businesses that are the subject of complaint by a local unit of government.
Subd. 5.Violations; administrative orders and penalties.

(a) The office may issue an administrative order to any licensed cannabis business or hemp business that the office determines has committed a violation of this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter. The administrative order may require the business to correct the violation or to cease and desist from committing the violation. The order must state the deficiencies that constitute the violation and the time by which the violation must be corrected. If the business believes that the information in the administrative order is in error, the business may ask the office to consider the parts of the order that are alleged to be in error. The request must be in writing, delivered to the office by certified mail within seven days after receipt of the order, and provide documentation to support the allegation of error. The office must respond to a request for reconsideration within 15 days after receiving the request. A request for reconsideration does not stay the correction order unless the office issues a supplemental order granting additional time. The office's disposition of a request for reconsideration is final.

(b) For each violation of this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, the office may issue to each cannabis business or hemp business a monetary penalty of up to $10,000, an amount that deprives the business of any economic advantage gained by the violation, or both.

(c) An administrative penalty may be recovered in a civil action in the name of the state brought in the district court of the county where the violation is alleged to have occurred or the district court where the office is housed.

(d) In addition to penalties listed in this subdivision, a person or business who violates the provisions of this chapter is subject to any applicable criminal penalty.
